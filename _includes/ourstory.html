						<h1 class="section-title">Our Love Story...</h1>
						<p class="section-desc">
						Dillon and Chelsea met in the magical city of Austin, TX. Dillon had
						lived in Austin for a few years after college and was currently
						working as a software engineer at iFly, while Chelsea moved there
						after college to work for College Forward while applying to medical
						schools. The two met at the start of Chelsea's year and hit it off,
						which gave Dillon the opportunity to show her all the best spots in
						Austin, including Zilker Park and McKinney Falls.
						</p>

						<p class="section-desc">
						The year flew by as
						the two bonded over many a taco and the year was coming to a close
						before Chelsea was to begin at Jefferson Medical College in
						Philadelphia, PA. The two decided to jet-set to New Zealand to
						celebrate the year and to get some fun in before Chelsea started
						school. They had a blast tasting wine, exploring Hobbiton, and bungee
						jumping, all in the gorgeous green backdrop of New Zealand. Soon after
						their adventure in a foreign land, Chelsea started at Jefferson and
						found herself immersed in a new world full of memorization and anatomy
						lab.
						</p>

						<p class="section-desc">
						After 5 long months apart, Dillon moved to Philadelphia at the
						start of 2015 and started the new year with a new location, job, and
						fianc√©e! Chelsea enjoyed the role reversal involved in introducing
						Dillon to Philadelphia with great new eats, historic sights, and
						exploration of the East Coast. Now in 2016, Chelsea is starting to see
						the end of her pre-clinical curriculum ahead, Dillon switched to his
						current position at OneTwoSee, and the two are eagerly awaiting their
						wedding in June!
